Setting the record straight is a strangely humbling experience.
I leave the work to be done in the hands of those more capable.

The lightbulb idea that came from all of this...

 - Graph Network of Ideas.
 - The Official Human Mind Map.
 - The Mind Map of Conscious Beings.

In Practicality - The current working idea for a project
 - Create an Encyclopedia that is specific to each individual
 	- based on G(V,E) where V are topics and E is education
 - Educational Tool
 - All idea are connected... or should be connected
 - V are topics
	- Encyclopedia entry
		- Apps
		- Webpage
		- Books
		- Ideally, it would be a "tome" of knowledge on a particular subject
	- Practical knowledge
		- Any physical experience that is required to understand topic
	- Foremost expertise
 - E are Education
	- The necessary education to move from one topic to the next
	- Assisted by the best AI
	- Assisted by the best teachers
	- Assisted by the best tools
	- Assisted by the best environment

(Think Skill Tree)
 - An Actual Skill Tree (example RPGs)
 - Implement using Graph Database
 - The V contain information about mastery of Topic
 - The E contain information about using the previous mastery to advance to the next V(Topic)

I for one still have love to pursue.
A life to live.
And a happy ending to find.
