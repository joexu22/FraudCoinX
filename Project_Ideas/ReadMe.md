# One Step at a Time

I for one still have love to pursue.

A life to live and time to lose.

And happy endings, all to find.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Though these projects may not be done,

I take my steps, one by one.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Roads will diverge, the path unclear

Fraught with perils to be fair.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

I know my beacon, which is true.

A sip of juice, of which there is two.

When my thoughts, stray to there,

A smirk I give, times unfair,

Winks are given to those who care,

Figure and figure, time is fair.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

And so I've been prompted to step away,

I only hope you don't go astray.
