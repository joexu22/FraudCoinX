# One Step at a Time

I for one still have love to pursue.
A life to live.
And a happy endings, all to find.

Though these projects may not be done,
I take my steps, one by one.

Roads will diverge, the path unclear
Fraught with perils to be fair.

I know my beacon, which is true.
A sip of juice, of which there is two.

When my thoughts, stray to there,
A smirk I give, times unfair,
Winks are given to those who care,
Figure and figure, time is fair.

And so I've been prompted to step away,
I only hope you don't go astray.
