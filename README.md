# This is a new BlockChain

There are no coins involved

This is a *new* de-centralized blockchain so you can theoretically out-mine everyone else and replace everyone elses ledger if you are quick enough.

Whoever is reading this, I'll buy you a coffee if you manage to mine some blocks, implement wallets, and somehow register a wallet to me

There are rumors that this will be dropped from the coffee standard though
