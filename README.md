# This is a new BlockChain

A simple insight into BlockChains is that a lot of energy goes into mining them.
This mining is quite wasteful.

It'll really be an improvement if somehow besides testing for hashkeys, the mining algorithm solves for important problems on the side.
Ideally, important questions can be converted into hashing algorithms, and then we would let the blockchain solve for them as people spend energy working towards the solution.
