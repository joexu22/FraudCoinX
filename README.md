# This is a new BlockChain

One insight gathered from my understanding of BlockChains is that a lot of energy goes into mining.
Each attempt at mining may seem unsuccessful and fruitless, but in reality they build the experience nessessary to accomplish the task at hand.

One aspect of a change I would purpose is that the mining algorithms for solving hashes would include in it the computation neccessary to solve the hardest pressing "mathmatical" questions.

Simply put, there is reward for trying.
There is no mistake too big to make...
